System Name: Smart Home Temperature and Fan Control System

Goal:
Automatically monitor and control room temperature in your home and report real-time data to your phone or PC using WiFi.

System Overview:
This system uses an Arduino Uno + WiFi Shield, a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, and a relay module to control a fan.

The WiFi connection allows:
- Sending temperature data to a web dashboard or mobile app
- Receiving remote commands to turn the fan ON or OFF manually

Components Used:
- Arduino Uno
- ESP8266 WiFi Shield or Arduino WiFi Shield
- DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- 5V Relay Module (connected to a fan)
- Power Supply
- Smartphone or computer with internet access

How It Works:
1. DHT11 sensor measures the room temperature and humidity every 5 seconds.
2. If temperature > 30Â°C, Arduino automatically turns on the fan using the relay.
3. Arduino sends data to a cloud service (like ThingSpeak, Blynk, or a custom server) via WiFi.
4. From your phone, you can view live data and send a remote command to override the fan control.
5. The system logs historical temperature and humidity data if needed.

Why WiFi is Important:
- Enables remote monitoring of room conditions
- Allows manual fan control from anywhere
- Supports smart home integration with Google Assistant or Alexa in future upgrades

Optional Features to Add Later:
- Buzzer alert if limits are exceeded
- Motion sensor for auto fan control
- Multiple sensors for a centralized home dashboard

Summary:
This system uses Arduino with a WiFi shield to monitor and control room temperature. WiFi is essential for remote monitoring, data logging, and user control, making it a smart and connected home automation solution.
